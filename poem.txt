SUPRISE
The suprise is still a suprise,
So i slove what i can the problems of man,
The suprise is still a msuprise,
So i love who I can Acording to plan,
The suprise is still a suprise,
So what will i find, Omisde of my mind,
the answers to some the questions of all, 
Where do you run Who do you call,
The blessings of life no suprise there,
Just Call out his name for he is everywhere,
The suprise is whats taking so long,
Let him into your heart thats where he belongs.
