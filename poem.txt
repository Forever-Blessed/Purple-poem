MYSTERY
The Mystery is still a mystery,
So i slove what i can the problems of man,
The Mystery is still a mystery,
So i love who I can Acording to plan,
The mystery is still a mystery,
So what will i find, Omisde of my mind,
the answers to some the questions of all, 
Where do you run Who do you call,
The blessings of life no mystery there,
Just Call out his name for he is everywhere,
The Mystery is whats taking so long,
Let him into your heart thats where he belongs.
